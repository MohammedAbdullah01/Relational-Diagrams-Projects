# 🧩 Relational Database Diagrams Collection

This repository contains a collection of **six real-world relational database designs**, each with a complete **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** and a ready-to-run **SQL script** that automatically creates the database schema.

Each system models a different business domain and demonstrates strong understanding of **relational modeling**, **normalization**, and **SQL implementation** — providing a practical foundation for backend development and data-driven applications.
